# A file
This is my **learning** _file_  
**learning** is bold, acutally _very_ bold by using and double underscore or asterik at either end of the word to be made bold type  
I use _fine_  single asterik or underscore on each side to italisize a word  
<!---seems like html still works here as well. God to know. --->
I'll add a link [here](https://www.google.com/) to google just for fun!
